    "changes": [
      "New test/storage.test.js: 23 tests covering the full credential and settings persistence layer",
      "Security invariant: secretKey must go to sessionStorage, not localStorage; asserted at the storage-value level",
      "Credential round-trip: all fields saved and loaded correctly; provider returns null (not empty string) when absent",

      "Delete tests: removal confirmed, no-op delete resolves cleanly, sibling keys are preserved",
      "computeFileHash tests: determinism, content sensitivity, and the partial-hash invariant (only head+tail 64 KB are hashed — two files with identical endpoints but different middle produce the same hash)"

      "Added explicit HTML/JS security invariant tests to mediaKind and mimeKind (these kinds must resolve to 'text', never a rendered type)",

      "Added MinIO and DO Spaces to defaultMaxKeys coverage",
      "Added Code-vs-name precedence test to parseS3Error",
      "Removed misleading BUG-007 comment from leafName tests",

      "dist/favicon.ico removed from the repo; ImageMagick build dependency dropped",

      "Falls back to a 512-byte Range request to compare build IDs when HEAD is inconclusive, instead of fetching the full page every poll",
      "Once a real update is confirmed, fetches the full page with default cache mode so the browser can cache it for the user's subsequent reload",
